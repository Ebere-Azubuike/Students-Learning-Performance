# Students-Learning-Performance using Power BI 
This project explains students' learning performance (Online or E-learning in focus) before and after the pandemic.

A total of 1000 students were surveyed through a questionnaire. Actionable insights from the data were to answer questions on;


# Project Objectives
To determine the distribution of gender within the dataset
To identify the study tools commonly used by the respondents?
To accertain the distribution of education levels among the respondents?
To know if there is any positive or negative change in students' scores before and after pandemic

# Data Sourcing
A total of 1000 students from different levels of education  were surveyed through a questionnaire from April to June 2020

# Data Cleaning/Transformation
Micosoft Excel was used to clean the data, trim spaces and replace some attributes, the data was then loaded and into Power Bi and further transformations were done using Power Query.

Some applied steps included:
1. Making first role headers
2. Changing data types
3. Creating new columns for aggregate scores 
4. Adding new measures for score changes

# Dataset Description
The dataset included these key attributes

1. Gender: Male, Female

2. Levels of Education: Bachelor's degree holders, Associate degree holders, Diploma,  College certificate holders, Senior  School Certificate Examination (SSCE) holders

3. Study Tools: Laptop, Destop, Tablets, Mobile Phone

# Data Analysis & Visualization
I used the DAX function to query my data by running some evaluations. 

For example, fetching top 100 students etc.

For the visualization I chose to create a simple and easy-to-understand visuals. To reflect the academic world,
I used white, red and blue colors. The idea behind my choice of color resonanted from the fact that in the academic setting, white papers are always used for examinations or note taking, school teachers mark scripts with red pen, while students often use the blue pen to write.
These colors are also bold and eye-catching, which helped to make the visuals more memorable, making it easier for a lay man to quickly understand it in just a glimpse.

I created a number of visuals to show the average scores, gender, level of education and study tools.

# The Dashboard comprises of these visuals:
# Study tools

1. Most students preferred to study using their Mobile device
2. Tablet was the least adopted study tool

# Gender

1. The respondents had more Females than Males, with a slight margin 58% (females) to 48% (males)

# Levels of Education

1. The distribution of education levels comprised of 5 levels viz;
BSc. (12%), Associate degree holders (22%), Diploma (20%), College certificate holders (29%), and SSCE (18%).
 
2. College certificate holders had the highest distribution in the questionnaire.

#Average Scores

1. Average scores by levels of education increased slightly across all levels of education after the pandemic with an average positive score of 3.6 to 2.6 across Bsc. to Diploma holders.

1. Student's scores in the mode of test administration (offline/online) increased a little after the pandemic, this could be a result of lesser stress and indoor studies during the pandemic

# Here's the dashboard i came up with

# Conclusion
In summary, the average score of students before the pandemic (66.09) slightly increased after the pandemic (69.17). which signifies that students' performance had a gradual boost during the pandemic as a result of e-learning implementation.
