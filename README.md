# Students-Learning-Performance using Power BI 
This project explains students' learning performance (E-learning in focus) before and after the pandemic.

A total of 1000 students were surveyed through a questionnaire. Actionable insights from the data were to answer questions on;

The distribution of gender within the dataset?
Which tool (Desktop, Mobile, Tablet, Laptop) is most commonly used by the respondents?
What is the distribution of education levels among the respondents?
How does the mode of test administration (online/offline) relate to the scores before and after the pandemic?
The average change in score (delta) before and after the pandemic for each level of education?


The gender distribution had 518 (52%) females  to 482 (48%) males.

with students making most of Mobile devices as their study tool.

The distribution of education levels comprised of 5 levels viz;
BSc. (12%), Associate degree holders (22%), Diploma (20%), College certificate holders (29%), and SSCE (18%). Thus College cert. holders had the highest distribution in the questionnaire.

Student's scores in the mode of test administration (offline/online) increased a little after the pandemic, this could be a result of lesser stress and indoor studies during the pandemic

Average scores by levels of education increased slightly across all levels of education after the pandemic with an average positive score of 3.6 to 2.6 across Bsc. to Diploma holders.

In summary, the average score of students before the pandemic (66.09) slightly increased after the pandemic (69.17). which signifies that students' performance had a gradual boost during the pandemic as a result of e-learning implementation.
