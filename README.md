# Students-Learning-Performance
The projects focus on students' learning performance (E-learning in focus) before and after the pandemic.
A total of 1000 students were surveyed through a questionnaire. Actionable insights from the data were to answer questions on;
The distribution of gender within the dataset?
Which tool (Desktop, Mobile, Tablet, Laptop) is most commonly used by the respondents?
What is the distribution of education levels among the respondents?
How many respondents reported normal mental health levels before the pandemic compared to during the pandemic?
How does the mode of test administration (online/offline) relate to the scores before and after the pandemic?
The average change in score (delta) before and after the pandemic for each level of education?
