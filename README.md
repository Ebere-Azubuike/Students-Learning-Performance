# Students-Learning-Performance using Power BI 
This project explains students' learning performance (Online or E-learning in focus) before and after the pandemic.

A total of 1000 students were surveyed through a questionnaire. Actionable insights from the data were to answer questions on;


# Project Objectives
To determine the distribution of gender within the dataset
To identify the study tools commonly used by the respondents?
To accertain the distribution of education levels among the respondents?
To know if there is any positive or negative change in students' scores before and after pandemic

# Data Sourcing
A total of 1000 students from different levels of education  were surveyed through a questionnaire from April to June 2020

# Data Cleaning/transformation
Micosoft Excel was used to clean the data, trim spaces and replace some attributes, the data was then loaded and into Power Bi and further transformations were done using Power Query.

Some applied steps included:
1. Making first role headers
2. Changing data types
3. Creating new columns for aggregate scores and score changes

The gender distribution had 518 (52%) females  to 482 (48%) males.

with students making most of Mobile devices as their study tool.

The distribution of education levels comprised of 5 levels viz;
BSc. (12%), Associate degree holders (22%), Diploma (20%), College certificate holders (29%), and SSCE (18%). Thus College cert. holders had the highest distribution in the questionnaire.

Student's scores in the mode of test administration (offline/online) increased a little after the pandemic, this could be a result of lesser stress and indoor studies during the pandemic

Average scores by levels of education increased slightly across all levels of education after the pandemic with an average positive score of 3.6 to 2.6 across Bsc. to Diploma holders.

In summary, the average score of students before the pandemic (66.09) slightly increased after the pandemic (69.17). which signifies that students' performance had a gradual boost during the pandemic as a result of e-learning implementation.
